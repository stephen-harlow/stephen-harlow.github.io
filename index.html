            <p>This is the second iteration of the drawing project. I took the main features of the ColorBack Project and changed the functionality to allow for touchscreen devices. </p>

            <p>This small side project was designed to test and expand my use of Jquery and HTML. to start, you simply have to move the mouse around. If you would like to move the mouse without drawing, press any key on the keyboard. You can select the background and circle color, along with the size of the circle. NOTE: This project does not work on mobile devices, due to the scrolling mechanism. </p>
